And this is my render URL :
https://twot-ai-p.onrender.com 
and the app should open with the same URL :
https://twot-ai-p.onrender.com

And this is how i deployed it to render:
your-render-app/
├── public/
│   └── index.html    (your HTML file goes here)
├── index.js          (the server file above)
└── package.json      (the package.json above)

So give me the .js and the .json files too.
